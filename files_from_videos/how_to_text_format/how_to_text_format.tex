This is an example of a bullet list.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hello, world!
  \item Hello, \textbf{world}!
  \item Hello, \textit{world}!
  \item Hello, \texttt{world}! The python package used was \texttt{matplotliblib.pyplot} and I stored the data in the location \texttt{my\_directory}.
\end{itemize}

This is now a numbered list.

\begin{enumerate}[a - ]
  \item Hello, world!
  \item Hello, \textbf{world}!
  \item Hello, \textit{world}!
  \item Hello, \texttt{world}! The python package used was \texttt{matplotliblib.pyplot} and I stored the data in the location \texttt{my\_directory}.
\end{enumerate}

The equation of a straight line is $y = mx + b$. If I would like to typeset a dollar sign is can do \$. The speed of light is given by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $c = 3.00 \times 10^{8}$ m/s.
  \item $c = $~\qty{3.00e8}{\meter\per\second}.
  \item Gravity is often used within the range of \qtyrange[range-units = single]{9.8}{10.2}{\meter\per\second\squared}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[{Random} a)]
  \item Let say "this is a quote", but that is incorrect, ``This is actually a quote''.
  \item This is a hyphen, -, this is an en-dash, --, and this is an em-dash, ---.
\end{enumerate}
